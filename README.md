# Attendance
Short python program to see whether a students attendance was satisfactory or not satisfactory.

I have 6 test cases in which the first and last of the list are acceptable and the middle four are not acceptable.

Example of a students attendace PPPALL will be satisfactory PPAALP will be unsatisfactory due to two or more absences and two or more consecutive late will also be unsatisfactory
PPPPLL will not be satisfactory. If a student has good attencdance print true otherwise print false.
